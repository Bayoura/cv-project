# CV Creator

- [Live Demo](https://bayoura.github.io/cv-project/)

On the left side there is a form where the user can input all their information. It is split in different sections: contact data, skills, personal profile, education and work experience. The number of the last two is customisable, so the user is able to input everything they deem important (e.g. having worked at multiple companies). If the user has no work experience yet, and they leave the text fields empty, it will not show up in the CV.
The right side shows a preview of the finished CV. It will update as soon as the user inputs something. Thus, the form and the preview are perfectly in sync.
On the bottom, there is a print/PDF button, which allows the user to print the CV or create a PDF.

## Thoughts for improvement:

- Add a photo feature (user can upload photo)
- the height of the CV is a bit wonky. It fits perfectly for printing, but for a PDF it's a bit too long. This is not a serious issue, though, because the user can just remove the second page of the PDF.
- the CV won't look good when it's more than one page because the sidebar (green background) cuts off where the content ends (so it doesn't go all the way down)
- create more in-depth responsive styles
